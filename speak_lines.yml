  - Hell yeah!
  - Try again later, champ.
  - In due time.
  - Don't bet on it.
  - Ha! Hahaha! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA- no.
  - Slow down, tiger!
  - Sure, but I'm not positive.
  - Maybe!
  - 'Not-so-calculated results: Affirmative!'
  - Perhaps asking a bot isn't the best way to solve this.
  - Pfft, what do I look like to you? A fortune teller?
  - Sure... _what could go wrong?_
  - Y-you're kidding, right?
  - That's a good one. I'll get back to you on that.
  - Oh jeez, why do they come to me with these shitty questions?
  - I wouldn't recommend it.
  - Anthony-programmed Anthabot approves!
  - Yes!
  - No.
  - Sounds good to me, despite my lack of human understanding.
  - AAAA I DON'T KNOW EITHER
  - "Survey says: 'NO, AND UR LAME'. Their words, not mine."
  - 'The real question is, why use a bot for a question like that, ya weirdo?'
  - I wanted to let you know that you are loved, and questions like that must be held.
  - Is that sarcasm?
  - LOL I'M JUST A BOT
  - Invalid command. Kidding - please specify a ***better*** question.
  - '~~As long as Anthony still develops my shitty system, sure.~~ // TODO: remove'
  - Stop! You violated the law! Pay the court a fine or serve your- bah, I'm just kidding, but sure, whatever floats your boat.
  - I cannot comment on at this time.
  - Hmmmmm... NEXT!
  - Let me check my watch... No.
  - If I were a god, I'd allow it... oh wait, I am.
  - No, yeah, just keep asking me dumb questions. I've got nothing better to do.
  - The odds of that are the odds of me giving a shit.
  - I guess if you're playing your cards right, it could work.
  - I don't see the point of this, so no-
  - Maybe you should get a better bot, Anthony. This is getting out of hand.
  - I'd say yes, after all - you're going to die someday.
  - Neh, you know it won't happen today, tomorrow maybe- but not today.
  - I was going to say yes, but then I decided otherwise, so no.
  - '```Receiving question... done Processing question... done Calculating answer... done\nFinal answer: Yes!```'
  - If I say yes, will you stop asking me all these damned questions?
  - I just want to say that I love you- but no.
  - Maybe in the next life, bud.
  - Hell yeah! That's the best thing I've heard in the short time I've been here.
  - Does not compute.
  - Yes! Ever heard of the band yes? No? Well that's your answer.
  - Sure, but get next time, get some friends.
  - Whatever they're paying me isn't enough.
  - May I interest you in a FRICKING YES? :D
